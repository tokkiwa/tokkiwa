## 25/09/24 New Paper is Out ðŸ¥³

Our new paper, "FlashGMM: Fast Gaussian Mixture Entropy Model for Learned Image Compression" is accepted by IEEE VCIP 2025! 

This paper accelerates the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), an well-known probability model of learned image compression, by ~90x while slighly improving its performance. 
I have submitted the pre-print version to arXiv. So it will be made available in a few days. Codes are released under [my repo!](https://github.com/tokkiwa/FlashGMM)


 
## 25/07/24 I built a Web Application âš¡
I made[ a simple web application named `arxivcite`](https://github.com/tokkiwa/arxivcite). This app allows you to easily cite arxiv's paper, with various format and style, by just changing the url (e.g. `arxiv.org/pdf/xxxx:xxxxx` to `arxivcite.org/pdf/xxxx:xxxxx`) on your browser. [Check it out! ](https://github.com/tokkiwa/arxivcite)
