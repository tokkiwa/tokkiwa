## 25/09/24 New Paper is Out ðŸ¥³

Our new paper, "FlashGMM: Fast Gaussian Mixture Entropy Model for Learned Image Compression" is accepted by IEEE VCIP 2025! 

This paper accelerates the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), an well-known probability model of learned image compression, by ~90x while slighly improving its performance. 
I have submitted the pre-print version to [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18815). Codes are released under [my repo!](https://github.com/tokkiwa/FlashGMM)
